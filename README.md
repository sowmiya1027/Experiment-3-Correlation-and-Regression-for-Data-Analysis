# Software Required: Python 

# Theory
1. Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables (say, X and Y).
  
2. If one variable changes, correlation tells us how the other variable changes on average.
   
3. The correlation coefficient (r) ranges from –1 to +1: +1 means perfect positive correlation, –1 means perfect negative correlation, and 0 means no correlation.
   
4. Regression shows how one variable (Y) depends on another variable (X). It provides a line (equation) that best fits the data.
   
5. The regression line of Y on X is expressed as:  Y = a + bX,  where a is the intercept and b is the regression coefficient (slope).
